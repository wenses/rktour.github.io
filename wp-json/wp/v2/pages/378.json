A yellow fever vaccination is only required to enter Kenya and Tanzania if you are arriving from, or have transited through, a yellow fever-endemic area in South America or Africa\u2013including East African countries such as Kenya and Uganda.

For guests visiting Kenya Only no need of yellow fever as it\u2019s not a MUST but recommended. For guests whose itinerary includes visits to both Kenya &amp; Tanzania safari, vaccination for yellow fever is necessary and you must carry an International Certificate of Vaccination provided by your physician; you may be denied entry without it. If your physician advises against receiving the vaccination because of your personal medical history, he or she can provide you with the necessary documentation for the country\/countries you are visiting. You will be travelling to areas of malaria transmission. We strongly advise that you speak with your doctor or travel clinic regarding your itinerary, individual risk assessment and options for mosquito bite prevention and antimalarial drugs. We recommend filling any prescriptions before you depart.[\/vc_toggle][vc_toggle title=&#8221;Do I need to take anti-malarial tablets while coming to Kenya?&#8221;]We strongly advise that you speak with your doctor or travel clinic regarding your itinerary, individual risk assessment and options for mosquito bite prevention and antimalarial drugs. We recommend filling any prescriptions before you depart.[\/vc_toggle][vc_toggle title=&#8221;What type of vehicles do you use for safari in East Africa (Kenya \/ Tanzania \/ Uganda and Rwanda)?&#8221;]\n<ul>\n<li>East Africa (Kenya \/ Tanzania \/ Uganda and Rwanda) is a hub for most travellers looking for an african safari adventure. In Kenya we have three types of vehicles that are used for safari based on client\u2019s choice. We have the Open Roof Tour van or also called open roof minibus and open roof landcuisers or open roof 4*4 vehicles and the open sided four by four land cruiser. Below are the differences for each so when planning your safari, you know what suites you best.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Open roof Tour Van<\/strong> \u2013 These vehicles are most common in a safari here in Kenya BUT NOT Tanzania. They are best preferred by guests that on a low budget since are lower priced as compared to all others. They have a seating capacity of 7 passengers comfortably seated. One at the front and 6 at the back on window seat guaranteed. The 6 at the back have the advantage of the open hatch also called the open roof access as compared to the front seating which has no open roof. They are featured with an open roof hatch, UHF radio call, individual seats, in some cases with limited recline and cooler boxes to store bottled water cold temperatures in hot areas. These vans are two-wheel drive hence in muddy and rocky terrain they tend to struggle to maneuver around during the wet seasons, but during the dry season they travel comfortably. Not being four wheel means in case they get stuck in muddy areas they need assistance from other cars. So incase guests are looking much into an off-road safari this car may not be suitable such as photography. Also some camps or lodges due to location we advise guests not to use this type of vehicle due to terrains in those regions. But a majority are fine to use the vehicle. The vehicle is generally a good vehicle to use on safari and clients using this vehicle should be aware of above details. Here are photos of the vehicle &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/mufasatoursandtravels.com\/mufasa-fleet\/open-roof-tour-vans\/\">https:\/\/mufasatoursandtravels.com\/mufasa-fleet\/open-roof-tour-vans\/<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Open roof Land cruiser<\/strong> &#8211; The other dominant type of Safari vehicle in Kenya and Tanzania is the 4&#215;4 Land Cruiser Safari land cruiser. These are often Toyota Land cruisers converted into Safari vehicles with the addition of pop up game viewing roofs [ front and main], safari customization, and addition of UHF radio calls and suitable seating of 7 people comfortably window seat guaranteed. Guests seating in front also has an open roof hatch same for guests seating at the back. A bigger percentage of the vehicles also come with an electric fridge instead of cooler boxes at the back seat to store water or other items at cold temperatures due to high temperatures in some places. Safari land cruisers are more capable for off road since they are four wheel drive full time and elevated and more comfortable as well over rocky and rough sections of roads, but will cost significantly more to use than safari tour vans. Here are photos of the vehicle &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/mufasatoursandtravels.com\/mufasa-fleet\/open-roof-land-cruisers\/\">https:\/\/mufasatoursandtravels.com\/mufasa-fleet\/open-roof-land-cruisers\/<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Open sided land cruisers<\/strong> \u2013 These are another type of land cruiser same brand of Toyota and are not commonly used for guests travelling by road to many parks for safaris since they are not allowed by the authorities to travel on highways from one park to the other due to safety reasons. These type of vehicles are commonly used by guests flying into parks from Nairobi and are commonly owned by camps and lodges located inside the reserves and parks not by the tour operators. Also since not all parks have airstrips if doing many parks can be a challenge to make use of this type of vehicle. Highly recommended to be used under our flying safaris subject to availability since camps have very limited vehicles, hence need book prior. If fully booked, we are recommended to send our normal open roof land cruisers at an extra cost since need travel one day prior to collect you from the airstrip on day of arrival since all cars are stationed in Nairobi office headquarter. Clients travelling by road incase want to use this vehicle need to book at an extra cost at the camp directly if the camp has such vehicles. In case of harsh weather can\u2019t make use of it such as rains as compared to the open roof land cruiser or tour van which you just shut down the hatch and proceed with game drives.
