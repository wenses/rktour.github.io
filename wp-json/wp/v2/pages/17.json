From the breathtaking landscapes to the abundance of wildlife, everything exceeded my expectations.\n\nOur driver cum guide Joseph was superb.\nI can't thank Joseph enough for being so awesome and excellent on everything.\n\nHighlights:\n\nGame Drives: The daily game drives through Maasai Mara were exceptional. We were fortunate to witness the Big Five\u2014lion, cheetah, elephant, rhino, and buffalo\u2014along with giraffes, zebras, and countless antelope species. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable and had a keen eye for spotting wildlife.\n\nScenery & Nature: The scenery was simply stunning, with vast savannahs, rolling hills, and golden sunsets that made for picture-perfect moments every day. The early morning mist over the plains was magical.\n\nCultural Experience: We also visited a local Maasai village, which added a rich cultural element to the trip. It was insightful to learn about their traditions, daily life, and deep connection to the land and animals.\n\nLodging & Hospitality: The safari lodges and tented camps were well-equipped, clean, and comfortable. The staff was incredibly welcoming, and the food was delicious, with options that catered to various dietary needs.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nThis safari was a perfect mix of adventure, relaxation, and learning. Kenya\u2019s rich biodiversity and warm hospitality make it a must-visit destination for nature and wildlife lovers. I highly recommend this experience to anyone seeking an authentic African safari.<!-- R-CONTENT --><\/div> <span class=\"ti-read-more\" data-container=\".ti-review-content\" data-collapse-text=\"Hide\" data-open-text=\"Read more\" ><\/span> <\/div> <\/div>  <div data-empty=\"0\" data-time=\"1748649600\" class=\"ti-review-item source-Google ti-image-layout-thumbnail\" data-id=\"cfcd208495d565ef66e7dff9f98764da\" > <div class=\"ti-inner\"> <div class=\"ti-review-header\"> <trustindex-image class=\"ti-platform-icon\" data-imgurl=\"https:\/\/cdn.trustindex.io\/assets\/platform\/Google\/icon.svg\" alt=\"Google\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" loading=\"lazy\" ><\/trustindex-image> <div class=\"ti-profile-img\"> <trustindex-image data-imgurl=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/ACg8ocJre9AoLsDLDcZsCOCeKst5V879Vz1c4UU_790mRwv1gIFcNw=w40-h40-c-rp-mo-br100\" data-imgurlset=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/ACg8ocJre9AoLsDLDcZsCOCeKst5V879Vz1c4UU_790mRwv1gIFcNw=w80-h80-c-rp-mo-br100 2x\" alt=\"lubna alhabsyi profile picture\" loading=\"lazy\" ><\/trustindex-image> <\/div> <div class=\"ti-profile-details\"> <div class=\"ti-name\"> lubna alhabsyi <\/div> <div class=\"ti-date\"><\/div> <\/div> <\/div> <span class=\"ti-stars\"><trustindex-image class=\"ti-star\" data-imgurl=\"https:\/\/cdn.trustindex.io\/assets\/platform\/Google\/star\/f.svg\" alt=\"Google\" width=\"17\" height=\"17\" loading=\"lazy\" ><\/trustindex-image><trustindex-image class=\"ti-star\" data-imgurl=\"https:\/\/cdn.trustindex.io\/assets\/platform\/Google\/star\/f.svg\" alt=\"Google\" width=\"17\" height=\"17\" loading=\"lazy\" ><\/trustindex-image><trustindex-image class=\"ti-star\" data-imgurl=\"https:\/\/cdn.trustindex.io\/assets\/platform\/Google\/star\/f.svg\" alt=\"Google\" width=\"17\" height=\"17\" loading=\"lazy\" ><\/trustindex-image><trustindex-image class=\"ti-star\" data-imgurl=\"https:\/\/cdn.trustindex.io\/assets\/platform\/Google\/star\/f.svg\" alt=\"Google\" width=\"17\" height=\"17\" loading=\"lazy\" ><\/trustindex-image><trustindex-image class=\"ti-star\" data-imgurl=\"https:\/\/cdn.trustindex.io\/assets\/platform\/Google\/star\/f.svg\" alt=\"Google\" width=\"17\" height=\"17\" loading=\"lazy\" ><\/trustindex-image><span class=\"ti-verified-review ti-verified-platform\"><span class=\"ti-verified-tooltip\">Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google.<\/span><\/span><\/span> <div class=\"ti-review-text-container ti-review-content\"><!-- R-CONTENT -->I had an absolutely amazing experience visiting Masai Mara with Mufasa Tours and Travel.

Thanks to him, we were able to see lions, elephants, giraffes, zebras, cheetahs, and many more.

Falling asleep to the sounds of the African wilderness was unforgettable.\n\nHosea's guidance and the excellent service from Mufasa Tours made this journey one of the most memorable trips of my life.

The wildlife, the landscapes, and the warmth of the people made this trip something we\u2019ll never forget.<!-- R-CONTENT --><\/div> <span class=\"ti-read-more\" data-container=\".ti-review-content\" data-collapse-text=\"Hide\" data-open-text=\"Read more\" ><\/span> <\/div> <\/div>  <div data-empty=\"0\" data-time=\"1744329600\" class=\"ti-review-item source-Google ti-image-layout-thumbnail\" data-id=\"cfcd208495d565ef66e7dff9f98764da\" > <div class=\"ti-inner\"> <div class=\"ti-review-header\"> <trustindex-image class=\"ti-platform-icon\" data-imgurl=\"https:\/\/cdn.trustindex.io\/assets\/platform\/Google\/icon.svg\" alt=\"Google\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" loading=\"lazy\" ><\/trustindex-image> <div class=\"ti-profile-img\"> <trustindex-image data-imgurl=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/ACg8ocIXu-vcLm1Qw1iQ92H4Kvf0IfJutPriyNmyp70CalE0JhDIIA=w40-h40-c-rp-mo-br100\" data-imgurlset=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/ACg8ocIXu-vcLm1Qw1iQ92H4Kvf0IfJutPriyNmyp70CalE0JhDIIA=w80-h80-c-rp-mo-br100 2x\" alt=\"Swadhin Patnaik profile picture\" loading=\"lazy\" ><\/trustindex-image> <\/div> <div class=\"ti-profile-details\"> <div class=\"ti-name\"> Swadhin Patnaik <\/div> <div class=\"ti-date\"><\/div> <\/div> <\/div> <span class=\"ti-stars\"><trustindex-image class=\"ti-star\" data-imgurl=\"https:\/\/cdn.trustindex.io\/assets\/platform\/Google\/star\/f.svg\" alt=\"Google\" width=\"17\" height=\"17\" loading=\"lazy\" ><\/trustindex-image><trustindex-image class=\"ti-star\" data-imgurl=\"https:\/\/cdn.trustindex.io\/assets\/platform\/Google\/star\/f.svg\" alt=\"Google\" width=\"17\" height=\"17\" loading=\"lazy\" ><\/trustindex-image><trustindex-image class=\"ti-star\" data-imgurl=\"https:\/\/cdn.trustindex.io\/assets\/platform\/Google\/star\/f.svg\" alt=\"Google\" width=\"17\" height=\"17\" loading=\"lazy\" ><\/trustindex-image><trustindex-image class=\"ti-star\" data-imgurl=\"https:\/\/cdn.trustindex.io\/assets\/platform\/Google\/star\/f.svg\" alt=\"Google\" width=\"17\" height=\"17\" loading=\"lazy\" ><\/trustindex-image><trustindex-image class=\"ti-star\" data-imgurl=\"https:\/\/cdn.trustindex.io\/assets\/platform\/Google\/star\/f.svg\" alt=\"Google\" width=\"17\" height=\"17\" loading=\"lazy\" ><\/trustindex-image><span class=\"ti-verified-review ti-verified-platform\"><span class=\"ti-verified-tooltip\">Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google.<\/span><\/span><\/span> <div class=\"ti-review-text-container ti-review-content\"><!-- R-CONTENT -->Our first safari experience with family was amazing.From the very beginning Joseph has worked with us in our  Itinerary patiently as changes were made.

A total waste of my time and money and I had to cancel it with them and was searching for someone else to continue my journey when I stumbled upon Mufasa. And they completely turned it around for me.\n\nAs I was already in Kenya, and wanted to start the trip again right away, I got a very prompt response from their customer team and they arranged everything for me in an overnight.\n\nThey assigned us a guide named Richard. Right from the moment he arrived in a brand new looking Land cruiser, we knew we were in good hands. He was not only friendly, humourous and highly knowledgeable about the wildlife, he also made sure to get back to us about any info\/fact that he wasn't sure about. I think that impressed us more than anything. Our driver\/guide is an encyclopedia of history, culture and everything Kenya. He is very passionate about his country and it showed in the way he communicated and conducted the Safari. Apart from the Rhino, we spotted all the big 5 and he even showed us some of the small 5 which few know about. He really made sure we got the best experience possible.\n\nThe accomodations they gave us were top notch. In Amboseli, we opened our eyes to the majestic Mt. Kilimanjaro and in Mara, we were greeted by Zebras grazing in front of our cabin every morning and went to sleep listening to the calls of hyenas every night.\n\nAll this sounds like I'm with the Mufasa marketing team, but booking with them has been the best last minute decision that I took that turned our trip completely for the best.<!-- R-CONTENT --><\/div> <span class=\"ti-read-more\" data-container=\".ti-review-content\" data-collapse-text=\"Hide\" data-open-text=\"Read more\" ><\/span> <\/div> <\/div>  <div data-empty=\"0\" data-time=\"1742774400\" class=\"ti-review-item source-Google ti-image-layout-thumbnail\" data-id=\"cfcd208495d565ef66e7dff9f98764da\" > <div class=\"ti-inner\"> <div class=\"ti-review-header\"> <trustindex-image class=\"ti-platform-icon\" data-imgurl=\"https:\/\/cdn.trustindex.io\/assets\/platform\/Google\/icon.svg\" alt=\"Google\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" loading=\"lazy\" ><\/trustindex-image> <div class=\"ti-profile-img\"> <trustindex-image data-imgurl=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/ACg8ocKLXFL1Xu5PUP0k7_sDzbYrzmoqW6bCtoQ4eVir-rO6w6Wt2g=w40-h40-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100\" data-imgurlset=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/ACg8ocKLXFL1Xu5PUP0k7_sDzbYrzmoqW6bCtoQ4eVir-rO6w6Wt2g=w80-h80-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100 2x\" alt=\"Amaia Mart\u00ednez Otalora profile picture\" loading=\"lazy\" ><\/trustindex-image> <\/div> <div class=\"ti-profile-details\"> <div class=\"ti-name\"> Amaia Mart\u00ednez Otalora <\/div> <div class=\"ti-date\"><\/div> <\/div> <\/div> <span class=\"ti-stars\"><trustindex-image class=\"ti-star\" data-imgurl=\"https:\/\/cdn.trustindex.io\/assets\/platform\/Google\/star\/f.svg\" alt=\"Google\" width=\"17\" height=\"17\" loading=\"lazy\" ><\/trustindex-image><trustindex-image class=\"ti-star\" data-imgurl=\"https:\/\/cdn.trustindex.io\/assets\/platform\/Google\/star\/f.svg\" alt=\"Google\" width=\"17\" height=\"17\" loading=\"lazy\" ><\/trustindex-image><trustindex-image class=\"ti-star\" data-imgurl=\"https:\/\/cdn.trustindex.io\/assets\/platform\/Google\/star\/f.svg\" alt=\"Google\" width=\"17\" height=\"17\" loading=\"lazy\" ><\/trustindex-image><trustindex-image class=\"ti-star\" data-imgurl=\"https:\/\/cdn.trustindex.io\/assets\/platform\/Google\/star\/f.svg\" alt=\"Google\" width=\"17\" height=\"17\" loading=\"lazy\" ><\/trustindex-image><trustindex-image class=\"ti-star\" data-imgurl=\"https:\/\/cdn.trustindex.io\/assets\/platform\/Google\/star\/f.svg\" alt=\"Google\" width=\"17\" height=\"17\" loading=\"lazy\" ><\/trustindex-image><span class=\"ti-verified-review ti-verified-platform\"><span class=\"ti-verified-tooltip\">Trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is Google.<\/span><\/span><\/span> <div class=\"ti-review-text-container ti-review-content\"><!-- R-CONTENT -->Joshua was an absolutely fantastic guide! He took great care of us throughout our trip and was incredibly knowledgeable. Thanks to him, we saw an amazing variety of wildlife, and he explained everything in detail about each animal we encountered.\n\nOne thing we truly appreciated was his deep respect for nature\u2014every time we spotted an animal, he made sure we stayed silent, turned off the engine, and avoided making any noise to fully enjoy the moment. His passion for wildlife was evident, and it made the experience even more special.\n\nThe vehicle was always spotless, well-organized, and very comfortable. Every day, the team made sure it was in perfect condition, which made our long journeys much more enjoyable.\n\nWe visited Lake Nakuru, Lake Naivasha, and spent four days in Masai Mara. Every single location was incredible, and the whole experience was perfect from start to finish.\n\nWe are deeply grateful for this unforgettable journey.
